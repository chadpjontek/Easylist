## What is the purpose of this app?
The purpose of EasyList is to allow you to make a simple note, list, or task and optionally share it with others. With shared tasks, you are also able to receive notifications upon completion.

## Features:
* Allows the creation of notes, lists, and tasks using a simple text editor with common formatting options.
* Works offline by caching the application shell and storing list data internally.
* When online and logged in, your lists will be synced to your account, allowing you to access your lists on any of your devices.
* Allows the sharing of the notes, lists, and tasks you create by copying a link to your clipboard which can then be given to whomever you choose.
* Turn on/off notifications for your tasks. An email will be sent to you when a task has been completed.
* Donate button to help me keep making cool stuff. :heart:
